Completed step 2

Steps:
    1: Fix compile errors
        - Add missing casting/declaration
        - Implement logic that did not decompile correctly
        - fix try/catch errors
    2: Refactor class variables names/functions to be readable
        - Fix references to incorrect static variables
        - Add new static variables
    3: Correct casting related warnings
        - Add types to Collections
        - Remove unnecessary castings
        - Update variable types to be more specific
    4: Identify and fix any faulty logic
        - Add checks for missed edge cases
        - Remove superfluous checks
    5: Optimize functions to be easy to flow/reduce complexity
        - ie: replace iterators whiles with foreach loops
        - move class variable initialization out of constructors
    6: Squash/expand functions to reuse/compartmentalize logic
        - localize creation of rarely used classes
        - move complex/shared logic into helper functions
    7: Add existing documentation to classes
        - Some classes have docs that exist in doc/javadoc (copy/paste or write script)
        - Add qualcomm disclaimer note to top of every file
